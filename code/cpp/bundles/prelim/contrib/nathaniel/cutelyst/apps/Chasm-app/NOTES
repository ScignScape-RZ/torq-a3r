The tsi folder will be regenerated if the generator is rerun.
If this folder already exists, the old folder will be renamed
   tsi.backup.  Note that any folder already named tsi.backup
   will be overwritten.
The tsi folder will be duplicated with the name tsi.orig.
   The idea is to preserve the autogenerated version of
   the folder and all its contents while the main tsi
   folder is modified.  Note that regenerating the tsi
   folder will also overwrite tsi.orig.
