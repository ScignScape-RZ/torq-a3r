`section.Parse-Superpositions and Theta Grids`
`p.
In light of the previous section, I think we can summarize 
the status of computational metaphors in linguistics 
as follows: if there is some explanatorily 
productive computational representation or simulation 
of linguistic processing, then there is a notion of 
beta reduction wherein convergence of `q.terms` 
(analogous, e.g., to phrases) on syntactic and/or 
semantic levels is coextensive with, or at least 
coordinates, a convergence of smeantic precision onto 
telic sentence-meanings.  The prior discussion 
outlined plausible models within enriched `q.term algebras` 
endowed with logical/quantification structures 
(as in Possible World semantics) or left/right adjacency 
(as in Combinatory Categorial Grammar combined with Conceptual 
Space semantics).     
`p`


`p.
In the present section I will propose an alternative 
`q.beta reduction modulo topology` model, and then 
consider to what extent schemata for 
deterministic beta reduction in `i.syntax` can indeed 
be extended to (presumptively formalizable) semantics.

`subsection.Are Parse Graphs (Qua Term Algebras with Solely Type-Level 
Evaluation) Unique?`
`p.
In the spirit of `Boltea;, however we intend to model 
semantics, it is reasonable to argue that syntax is 
necessary to orchestrate the order of semantic combination.  
We can leave the cogntive status of juxtaposed semantic 
constituents open-ended for now: a sense of `q.concept addition` 
is a useful place-holder, but I do not assume we have a non-circular 
account of what it means, in general, to `q.add` two concepts together.  
Conceptual Space theory attempts to present such an account, 
but its specific parameters of dimensionality, convexivity, 
constrast classes, and so forth, are not necessarily a persuasive 
systematization exception for special cases (not to imply 
that some other formalization is better).  Syntactically, 
however, parse graphs %-- at least as posited retroactively %-- 
do appear to have determinimistic structures mimicking 
a term algebra (the problem for Natural Language Processing 
is that, `i,prima facie`/, semantic information is needed to 
pure the space of potential parses, so we seem to be in a 
catch-22 wherein semantic understanding is a predondition for 
syntax and vice-versa). 
`p`


`p.
In short, I leave open the possibility that syntax and semantics 
are cognitively entangled such that there is no non-circular 
formulation of how parse-graphs are `i.realized` that does 
not involve semantic reasoning, and vice-versa.  Nonetheless, 
parse-graphs as syntactic artifacts do have a determinative 
structure, even if it is not clear how that tractability plays a 
role in actual language understanding.  Given a parsed sentence, 
we can always apply a type system wherein constitutent 
words/phrases are assigned distinct types (based on 
grammatical categories or Parts of Speech) and where most 
words (other than nouns) are categorized by the types of their 
siblings in relation to containing phrases.  It seems 
reasonable to ground the type system on the two canonical 
categories of Propositions and Nouns, and other types 
introduced by derivation.  For instance, verbs are a type 
that, when combined with one, two, or three nouns, 
yields propositional phrases.  A correct sentence converges  
to a single `q.root` proposition (with allowance for mood variation, 
e.g. the difference between asking a question and issuing a command), 
a process which is essentially a form of beta-reduction so long as 
we take phrases as terms and part-of-speech `q.types` as values assigned to terms 
(abstracting lexical details).   
`p`


`p.
Although reconstructing parsing details would seem to be 
straightforward for many sentences, there may be more 
siutations of theoretical ambiguity (which might or might 
not correlate with actual communicative ambuity) than 
we one expect.  Consider examples like 

I looked out the window.
I climbed up a tree.

Are the verbs `q.look` and `q.climb` with objects `q.out the window` 
and `q.up a tree`/?  Or are they `q.look out` and `q.climb up`/?  
The parse-graphs would obviously be different, since the prepositions 
(`i.out` and `i.up`/) would be attached to the verb in one case 
and to the direct-object phrase in the other.`footnote.
I will typically speak of parse `i.graphs` and not `i.trees` because 
of phenomena such as anaphora resolution, that link leaf-nodes 
across phrase boundaries.  The presence of such edges technically 
make these structures in to graphs rather than trees, even if the 
edges involved can be ignored for purposes of type-convergence.
`footnote`
`p`


`p.
Consider the following scenario: a bloke and his girlfriend are sitting 
on her sofa.  He's reading and she's talking on the phone.  He stands 
up and says 

I'm going out to the store.

Is the verb `i.go` or `i.go out`/?  Note that out intrpretation 
might be influenced by enunciation patterns.  Suppose that the girlfriend 
is seemingly engrossed in her conversation, and he does not wish to 
unduly disturb her.  So he holds onto the possibility of keeping his 
comment as short as possible.  He might just say `q.I'm going out`/, 
if she appears distracted and only minimally paying attention.  On the 
other hand, if she shifts her focus away from the phone and looks 
at him more directly, he might take that as a cue to state 
more information; instead of a curt `q.going out` he says () instead, 
providing a rationale for his actions.
`p`


`p.
We tend to analyze sentences as if they emerge fully-formed, but in 
real life speaking happens in the midst of social interactions, 
and people often adjust their speech-acts whle observing listener's 
responses in the interim.

I found the owner of that dog from yesterday %-- you know, the 
one who was playing with `Keyush; %-- she lives down the block.

The speaker might include that supplemental phrase identifying 
to dog because of feedback from the addressee's facial expression; 
if instead they gave the impression of immediately grasping 
the referent for the `q.dog from yesterday` then the speaker might 
have skipped the interregnum entirely.  And, verbal contours and 
streeses differentiate what the speaker believes to be new information 
versus familiar details vis-a-vis their listeners, or to sculpt a 
speech act's meaning relative to common information.  Given

You're coming with us on Saturday, right?

a verbal emphasis on `i.you` seeks clarifiction that the person addressed 
%-- not someone else %-- is to join them; stressing `q.us` would be 
to confirm that the person is coming with a group including speaker 
and not some different group; and emphasizing Saturday contrasts with 
some other day.  Obviously, () would be spoken in a context where 
at least one of these points of information has plausible alternatives 
%-- e.g., if  Saturday is highlighted then there must be some 
analogous trips happening on a different day %-- and presumably 
both speaker and listener share beliefs about these details.  
But articulatory patterns can confirm that their collective 
beliefs are indeed as coordinated as the speaker assumes; 
it is a way for the speaker to signify beliefs `i.about` 
shared beliefs alongside the sentence's explicit content.  
`p`


`p.
Notated parse-graphs would ordinarily overlook such 
prosodic details.  However, mannerisms in how sentences 
are enunciated will potentially favor one parse 
over another.  Getting back to (), an extended pause 
after `q.going out` would reinforce the impression that 
those two words are a verb-phrase, whereas a gap 
`i.between` them leans toward tieing `q.out` 
with the direct object (arguably, in the former 
case `q.going out` is `i.in`/transitive, and 
`q.to the store` serves as further specification 
rather than an actual direct object; viz., as 
part of the verb's theta grid.`footnote.
Contrast with `i.pointed out`/, which is not 
complete on its own.  Here too a corner case 
might be `q.pointed out the window`/, which can 
be read either as `q.calling attention to` 
the window %-- the idiomatic sense of `q.to point out` 
%-- or as point `i.at` something which is 
`q.out` (i.e., on the other side of) the window.  
It is rare that there'd be a context where the 
second reading is plausible, however.
`footnote`)  The two alternations, as I see it, 
do evince slightly different meanings.  
The version `q.I'm going ... out to the store` 
would befit a circumstance wherein the 
listener makes it clear that she thinks he 
might be going `i.somewhere`/, but would 
like to know `i.where`/.  The coupled 
`q.going out` version would model a situation 
where `q.I'm going out` is a complete idea in 
its own right, and `i.to the store` is a 
secondary detail. 
`p`


`p.
Here again the contrast derives from competing possibilities 
for what prior information is shared between the two 
parties.  If the guy stands and the girlfriend looks at 
him with an inquisitive expression, he would presume that 
she's seeking confirmation that he is in fact going 
`i.somewhere` (not just standing up temporarily, e.g., 
to stretch) and perhaps to where.  It is the `q.going` 
that is topicalized, and the sentence is crafted to 
fill in details about that commonly-identified situation 
(the appearance, which should be confirmed, that the boyfriend 
is indeed going somewhere).  In the other scenario, the 
dude wants to briefly get her attention and does not necessarily 
have data to suggest that she is aware of his making motions 
as if to go somewhere; starting with less common information, 
he wants to make a quick precis and summarizes  
with `i.I'm going out`/, which in itself is what she 
needs to know (lest she wonder where is his a few minutes 
later); the `q.to the store` does not add `i.crucial` 
insight, though it's natural that he'd want to clarify 
his motives (the kind of supplemental declarations we'd tend 
to include simply to sustain the public perception that 
we do not tend to wander places with no purpose).  In short, 
given the contour of information which is shared, new,  
up for confirmation, and most (as well as less) important, 
the assertion `q.I'm going out` simpliciter may or may 
not represent a `q.complete idea` vis-a-vis information content.  
In other words, when assessing whether a verb-plus-noun 
combination is a finite clause, we should consider 
dialogic situations, not just decontextualized 
intimations of propositionality.  `q.I'm going out` is a complete 
idea in abstraction, but in a specific conversation and 
interpersonal situation, it may be incomplete relative to 
maxims toward saying things that listeners will find relevant 
(i.e., information-bearing).    
`p`


`p.
In short, once we factor information novelty and confirmation into the 
equation, the competing parses do take on distinct communicative 
connotations.  But what about a `q.neutral` prosody which does not 
favor either a grouping of `q.out` with `q.going` or `q.to the store`/?  
Stripped to a propositional core, is there actually a semantic 
difference between the state of affairs reported by a sentence 
parsed via going-out as VP versus `q.out` as preposition?  
`p`


`p.
It is certainly true that in `i.some` contexts the meanings would 
be effectively identical %-- there might not be any 
information-flow patterns that present a structural 
contrast between one parse or another.  In such contexts a 
person reporting `q.I'm going` would describe a trajectory; 
() presents the itinerary of first leaving his current 
location and, after purposeful movement toward a destination, 
ending up at the store.  The `q.out` part focuses on the 
first portion of this spatial path and `q.to the store` 
on the endpoint; thus they cognitively highlight different 
segments in the total trajectory.  But the segments belong 
within a single path, and there may be no cognitive 
motivation for attending more to the beginning or to the end.  
If that is the case, () should be read as if the two 
alternate parses are indeed semantically equal; the cognitive 
balancing between path-start and path-end (neither being 
foregrounded more than the other) manifests as a parsing 
protocol where `q.out` seems poised between connection to the 
verb or the subsequent phrase.  But () leaves open the 
`i.possibility` of prosodic variations that profile the 
path-start or path-end more intensely, in which case 
one or another of the parsing options become more accurate.   
`p`


`p.
One way to model this situation would be to acknowledge the 
coexistence of multiple plausible parses.  The graph 
linking `q.out` to `q.going` does not necessarily imply a 
different `i.cognitive` construal compared to the 
alternative %-- if there is no differential in attention or 
situation-specific information content associated with 
the start versus the end of his reported itinerary.  
The grammar of () is such that vocal emphasis can 
nudge toward one parse or another if they are 
situationally distinct, but also support a `q.neutral` 
reading where the relevant cognitive phenomena do 
not convincingly implicate one parse versus the other.  
A reasonable theoretical overview of this situation might 
be to question the assumption that a sentence necessarily 
has one single parse-decomposition %-- not as a matter of 
ambiguity, but as a model of situations where 
multiple construals overlap and synthesize.  Parse structured 
imply a carving of sentence elements into groupings 
which tie situational details together according to certain 
patterns, but speakers' overall cognitive framing does not 
necessarily evince an analogous carving-up.  In a `q.neutral` 
enunciation. the first part of the speaker's implicit 
path in () does not bind to its beginning point (the act of standing, precipitating 
() being said in the first place), nor does the path-end to its 
telos (arriving at the store), with more force than the path-segments 
bind to one another.  The `q.out` component of the trajectory 
%-- presumably when the speaker leaves the building %-- is not (let's assume)  
cognitively glued more to the initial action (standing up) than to the 
end (reaching the store) or vice-versa.  Both parses, if mapped to 
patterns of cognitive attention, would imply a foregrounding 
of one linkage between portions of the spatial path than others, 
which may not be warranted.  To properly model the sitaution, then, we could 
say that only the co-existence or superposition of both parses 
paints the correct cognitive picture %-- at least unless there is 
compelling (context-specific) evidence otherwise. 
`p`


`p.
As such, I think it is reasonable to extend our model of parse-graphs to 
include the possibility of multiple dissimilar parses all somehow 
contributing to an overarching cognitive model of the sentence.  
Distinct parses represent distinct distributions of cognitive 
attention, and in some contexts one parse might stand out 
as more attuned to cognitive details than others; but elsewhere 
each given parse should be treated as an approximation, a 
tracing of cognitive organization creating the illusion of artifacts 
that do not actually correspond to bonafide structural posits.  
If the `q.out to the store` path is profiled in a balanced way, with 
no segment or transition between segments prioritized over 
others, than no single parse of () properly conveys 
that neutrality.  We have to treat the alterantives 
as different windows onto a single cognitive articulation; 
only their superposition presents an unbiased cognitive sketch.  
`p`


`p.
To the basic model of parse-graphs characterized by type-convergence 
toward Proposition completeness, I would therefore add a 
specific structural parameter: namely, that certain sentences 
are endowed with competing or juxtaposed graphs, which in 
some cases have to be `q.superimposed` into order to proper 
model the given sentence qua cognitive phenomenon.  In other 
cases contextual and/or prosodic factors have to be 
identified which give precedence to one graph over another.  
The different possibilities for interplay `i.between` graphs 
represents an enrichment of the representational capacities 
of any parsing framework beyond the resources of `i.single` 
graphs on their own.
`p`


`p.
Having proposed that added structural detail, I now want to 
revisit the question of parse graph's explanotory scope, in the 
sense of the formalizations embodied in them.  
It is true that such graphs represent a deterministic 
type-convergent process.  To what extent can we 
leverage or expand that phenomenon toward a 
theory of meaning itself being similarly deterministic 
and logico-computationally tractable?
`p`

`subsection.Theta Grids and Type Systems`
`p.
Convergence-to-Proposition, as type checking or (type-level) 
beta-reduction, carries only limited information because the 
attribution of a type to a word/phrase conveys much less 
semantic content than actual lexical meanings.  Of course, a 
thorough grasp of sentences' meanings depends on 
identifying specific dictionary definitions and also 
open-ended pragmatics in context, mapping proper names 
to the relevant person (and not just any Dave, etc.) 
and so on.  There is, however, an intermediate 
realm of specificity beyond minimal parts of speech 
but still abstracting lexical (and pragmatic) details.    
`p`


`p.
For example, the grammatical category of nouns can be divided 
in terms of singular/plural and mass/count.  Plural inflection 
(the `q.s` in English) marks the noun as designating 
some non-singular set, and also as comprised of discrete 
`q.countable` objects, details that have some semantic 
bearing.  As an example,

He brought some beers for us to taste 

implies that they are sampling a variety of `i.different` beers, 
as far as brewery, style, etc., by virtual of the count-plural 
`q.beers` (contrast with `i.some beer`/, non-plural).    
`p`


`p.
Some verbs, of course, only take (for instance) mass nouns, or plurals.  
From the primordial Verb plus Noun yields Proposition, then, we 
can refine the rule (when appropriate) by specifying that the 
Noun fall somewhere preordained on the single/count-plural/mass 
spectrum.   
`p`


`p.
Analogous narrowing occurs in the context of `q.semantic roles` 
wherein situational `q.actants` have to meet certain criteria.  
As far I as I can tell, the most popular linguistic terminology 
for thematic-relation preconditions employs the concept 
of `q.valency` which %-- in addition to minimal stipulations 
that specific verbs require one, two, or three `q.arguments` 
(intransitive, transitive, or ditransitive) %-- supports designation 
of requisite grammatical and/or semantic categories.  For example, given 

John believes that Tim Walz is a good vice-presidential nominee

we assume that the direct-object argument to `q.believe` has to be 
some complete idea, i.e., a proposition.  There are different 
ways to express that condition.  The approach I assume here 
reflects my earlier comments about type-checking and term algebras: 
at a purely syntactic level well-formed sentences can always 
be given a parse-graph which type-checks within a kind of beta 
reduction, where words/phrases are substituted with grammatical 
categories.  By that paradigm, phrases should be typed 
according to their position in an iterative convergence, 
at least when assigning generic types like Noun and Verb.  
On this account, a `q.clause` such as `q.Walz is a good nominee` 
functions grammatically as a noun, even if semantically 
it derives from a proposition. 
`p`


`p.
In this case, the word `q.that` serves as an operator, effecting in essence a 
`q.type cast`/: the phrase `i.after` `q.that` (Tim Walz is a good vice-presidential nominee) 
is indeed a clause (a complete idea; it works standalone as a sentence) 
but the presence of `q.that` converts the entire phrase (back) to a noun.  
Here `q.that` is a conjunction, which can be assigned a type 
such as P -> N: given a clausal `q.argument`   
(a phrase typed as Proposition) yield a phrase typed as Noun.  
Here, though, we are recognizing only coarse Part of Speech 
types.  Assuming we entertain more granular grammatical categories, 
we could designate more specific `q.subtypes`/, such as noun-phrases that 
actually `q.encapsulate` clauses, by virtue of being formed via a 
subordinator such as `q.that`/, `q.unless`/, `q.after`/, and so forth.  
`p`


`p.
To be more precise, notice that the requirements for `q.believe` 
%-- or similar words such as `i.agree with`/, `i.confirm`/, etc. %-- are 
essentially semantic, not syntictic.  Common examples show that 
such semantic conditions can be realized through a number of different 
grammatical formatios:

We can confirm that a suspect has been brought in for questioning.
I agree with your assessment.
I believed what the Guardian reported.
I believed the news reports.
The White House confirmed as much.
She said so.

Here the direct objects all suggest some propositional content, but such 
content is conveyed in numerous ways, including descriptive 
phrases (`q.your assessment`) and open-ended, context-dependent 
words or phrases (`q.as much`/, `q.so`/).  The admissibility is 
not driven solely by the nature of bridge words like 
`q.that` or `q.what`/, because there are counter-examples if the 
resulting phrase does not fit the semantic criteria:

I believe what you said.
I believe everything you said.
I like what you're wearing.
I know this much is true.
I enjoyed everything the restaurant served.
* I believe what you're wearing.
* I believed everything the restaurant served.
I believed everything the restaurant claimed. 
`p`

`p.
Consider () [I like what you're wearing].  The verb 
`i.wear` is transitive, and `q.what` evidently stands 
in for the direct object.  So the point is to create 
an alternative means of referring to whatever plays 
that role: if the addressee is wearing a dress, then 
() expresses admiration for that dress, and so on.  
Ordinarily, a transitive verb with two noun-arguments 
yields a proposition, like `q.you're wearing a dress` 
%-- or even `i.you're wearing what?`/, pronounced 
with stess on the last word, a statement clearly 
intended not to assert some fact but to convey 
incredulity or object to a fact.  Still, the verb-plus-nouns 
yields a complete idea.  By making `q.what` a direct 
object and also transposing the word order, the 
phrase appears to lose its status as a proposition and 
instead to become a noun %-- there is still a complete 
idea in the background, but the point of the phrase 
is to signify whatever object would fulfill the 
direct-object role in an ordinary proposition given the 
current context (e.g., `q.that dress` is the person is 
wearing a dress).  The best way to notate this 
phenomnon is to perhaps identify a new top-level type 
%-- perhaps it could be called a `q.de dicto` referent, 
or D %-- intended as a floating signifier for 
whatever occupies a given semantic position contextually.`footnote.
Not to imply that there is a corresponding `q.de re` type 
in accord with the philosophical de re/de dicto distinction.  
There are situations which that distinction would be 
consequntial for understanding a sentence, but they 
probably involve special contextual circumstanecs.
For instance, in `q.the dress that she is wearing will be red` 
the speaker might already know about said dress, authorizing the 
assertion of its being red; or they might say this because 
the dress is part of some program or costume which is planned to be 
red, but they are not implying that there is a specific dress in their 
mind at the moment of enunciation.  That distinction seems orthogonal 
to my current point about a `q.D` type; even in the second case the 
Vt + N + D = N formula would still seem correct, as in 
`q.I am sure you'll like the dress she'll be wearing`/. 
`footnote` 
If a transitive verb obeys Vt + N + N = P, the D-type 
would yield an alternative type-assignment rule, namely 
Vt + N + D = N.  The `q.D` type thereby converts apparent 
Propositions to nouns, but via a different mechanism that 
(e.g.) `q.that` casting a complete phrase to back to a noun:

I like what you are reading.
I like that you are reading. 

To see how this might work in a parse-structure, 
the formulas in () would read something like 

Vt + N + (Vt + N + D) = P

which type-checks, substituting N for Vt + N + D.
`p`


`p.
Getting back to (), the problem with () in its stead 
is that people do not wear beliefs (except metaphorically) so 
the direct object does not fulfill the thematic requirements 
of `q.to believe`/.  Asserting that `q.believe` is 
transitive %-- satisfying V + N + N = P %-- merely 
states syntactic conditions; there is an additional 
semantic condition wherein the content of the second 
N may be construed as an idea, opinion, statement of 
fact, or some other entity of an intellectual/ideational 
nature (and not a physical thing, or any abstract object 
that is not somehow `q.propositional`/).  For sake 
of discussion, I will call a noun `q.ideational` if it 
does satisfy such criteria.  So, in the 
formula V + N + N = P for `i.believe`/, there is a 
`i.semantic` requirement that the second N be 
in fact ideational.  One way to satisfy that requirement 
would be for the direct object to be a phrase 
constructed according to an S + P = N rule 
%-- `q.S` for subordinator, e.g. `q.that` %-- 
but such is an artifact of how subordinators 
work semantically.  Indeed, we could revise 
the rule just notated to read something 
like S + P = N:ideational, indicating the 
extra data on the constructed phrase.       
`p`


`p.
Formulae such as S + P = N:ideational 
and (continuing this idea) V + N + N:ideational = P 
(for `i.believe`/) appear to combine syntactic and semantic 
desiderata.  This perhaps suggests two possible treatments.  
We could accept analyses wherein grammatical categories 
could have more refined subtypes %-- perhaps retaining 
Part of Speech to identify the most general, purely-syntactic 
types, whereas other categories might represent 
plurals, mass/count, and semantic presuppoisitions such as 
N:ideational %-- and consider type-assignment with such 
more granular categories to be simply a more detailed 
exposition of phrase-hierarchies and type-convergence.  
In this case, we still have type-checking as a form 
of beta reduction within term algebra; but we allow a 
wider range of type-expression that can label terms, 
with correspondingly more detailed reduction rules, 
such as S + P = N:ideational.  The genre of semantic 
constraints relevant to, say, the direct-objett 
of `i.believe` is here modeled via formally identical 
mechanisms to purely syntactic requirements such as a 
proposition needing a verb and a noun.    
`p`


`p.
Conversely, a different style of analsys might separate 
out the minimal syntactic type-checking from the 
more conceptually specific semantic-role constraints, 
such as N:ideational.  This would be more in keeping 
with preconditions deriving from purely lexical 
considerations: a `i.baseball statistic` is well-formed 
whereas `i.baseball touchdown` is not, but the 
difference depends on specific real-word details 
about the phenomenon to which `q.baseball` refers.  
In short, it is almost entirely extra-linguistic.  
A philosophical issue would be whether `q.intermediate` 
restriction such as N:ideational %-- more granular than 
purely syntactic Parts of Speech but less specific than 
purely lexical details %-- are closer to the former 
or to the latter, in terms of how we process them 
mentally.  If %-- whether for well-thought-out reasons 
or just because it feels better presentationally %-- 
we do separate out semantic-role from pure-syntax constraints, 
then the former would end up being modeled essentially 
akin to `q.theta grids`/, outlining specifications for 
proper use of a verb, keyed to specific word-meanings 
(in this sense, the framework is lexical more than 
syntactic; however, the specs tend to fit general patterns, 
rather than lexical idiosyncracies like 
`q.baseball bat` versus `q.football bat`/). 
For a given verb, for each dictionary sense, there are a 
series of situational restrictrions on (potentially) 
all arguments (subject and object(s) both); the 
distinct contributions of each argument are often called 
`q.theta` roles, so that the full matrix of requirements 
becomes a theta grid.   
`p`


`p.
With respect to `i.believe`/, observe that in addition to the 
object being `q.ideational` we must have a subject which is 
capable of entertaining beliefs, or in philosophers' terms 
of having propositional attitudes.  Such might be called a 
`q.sentience` criterion, and it gets revealed by well-formedness 
tests as well as metaphoric constructions:

* That boulder really loves sunshine.
? The plant on the patio is very thirsty.
? These flowers want water.
The White House believes Israel will retaliate.
? Next door wants to host a barbeque Sunday.

In () and () we rhetorically stretch the convention that only 
animals have conscious experience, which might register `q.want` in general, 
or `q.thirst` (a desire for water) in particular; the premise is that plants 
`i.need` water, and as such their lack of water could be described obliquely 
via expressions for animals' `i.experience` of insufficient hydration.  
When syntactic conventions are disobeyed in ways that strongly suggest a 
concise metaphoric `q.resolution` to the violation %-- often entreched into a 
familiar idiom or turn of phrase, which is arguably the case in () and () %-- 
then sentences become admissible in practice; but the deviation of usage 
from a standard theta-grid is still in effect, being precisely which 
triggers a metaphorical (rather than literal) meaning in the first place.  
In (), by contrast, the noun-subject White House is clearly being employed 
here according to the convention that naming a government building obqliquely 
references the persons typically conducting business `i.in` the building.  
This seems less a metaphor than a referential convention, which is too 
sporadically in force to be a general pattern rather than a popular 
idiom.  In particular, the idiom only works seamlessly for 
landmarks of government entities; it is dubious for normal residential 
buildings (see ()) and commercial interests (idiomatic cases like 
`q.Well Street is getting nervous` are non-generalizable one-offs; 
we can't have `q.1st Avenue is getting nervous` with intent to single 
out diplomatic office clustered near the United Nations, for instance).        
`p`


`p.
In short, the theta grid for `q.believe` stipulates an N:sentient 
subject and N:ideational object %-- in the terms/notation I adopt 
here (I will not bother to sketch it out systematically).  Those 
requirements are flexible enough to tolerate some 
level of metaphoric substitution or refernetial indirection, but 
they disallow constructions which cannot (allowing for some 
interpretation) fit into the grid's schema.  A theta-role 
theory accordingly requires some inventory of narrowings 
which would be subtypes of nouns (and potentially other parts 
of speech too), such as N:sentient and N:ideational.  
Normally the verb `i.go` would require a `i.destination` 
(say, N:location) which compels its own set of interpretive resolutions:

He went ballistic.
Let's go to Grandma.
Let's go to the press.

In () the `q.travel` is figurative, in an abstract space of 
emotional states [].  Meanwhile () obviously envisions a 
journey to some `i.place` where Grandma is, but that wording 
both designates that place concisely and states the rationale 
(as I considered earlier vis-a-vis going `i.to the store`/, incorporating 
reports of rationale is a common practice perhaps deriving from maxims 
of information relevance: rationales increase information-content and 
-relevance).  And () implies intent to divulge some information to 
reporters, which `i.might` happen by physically visiting a newspaper 
office (or some other specific location) but () does not rule out 
communication by phone or email (without literally going anywhere).  
That is, () appears to use one representative class of `i.instances` 
of some typical situation (people physically meeting with reporters with the 
hope of getting some information published) with intent only to convey the 
broad outlines of that kind of situation (the literal in-person meeting 
becoming optional). 
`p`


`p.
Saying that `i.go`/s object requires N:location, then, is not a mechanical 
insistence that every such noun must name a place; but whenever the precondition 
is violated an interpretive process is triggered which rereades the actual 
object as obliquely identifying a place (e.g., Grandma's house) %-- even 
if the inferred place (e.g., a newspaper office) is not actually visited, 
but rather the sentence presents a scenario functionally similar to 
one involving literal travel to said place.  Reinterpretation can 
also happen in the opposite direction, where a place obqliquely 
references a group of people, government, or institution: 

Toronto announced plans to build a world-class cricket grounds.
Toronto, which is home to many South Asian immigrants, could spearhead a 
 drive to host the Cricket World Cup in Canada.
Many South Asian immigrants live in Toronto.
 
In the first two sentences, `q.Toronto` is clearly being used here as referring 
to its city government.  The () case is subtler, because `q.live in` would 
ordinarily be seen as needing an N:location, but the proposition encoded by () 
is also present as a parenthetical clause in ().  According to a common analysis, 
such as [] (Zhao?), nouns may often be reclassified according to multiple 
`q.subtypes`/, but usually not in the same sentence.  For instance, `q.that 
newspaper` can be read as a place, an object, or an institution: 

I walked by that newspaper this morning.
That newspaper has coffee stain on it.
That newspaper has endorsed Kamala Harris.

but switching between them is dubious:

* That newspaper, which endorsed Kamala Harris, has coffee stain on it.
? I walked by the Times, which endorsed Kamala Harris, this morning.

I will return to these examples presently. 
`p`


`p.
There is a robust body of literature which employs type-theoretic 
constructions to analyze requirements on theta grids 
(in effect; sometimes the terminology varies) as well as interpretive 
resolutions triggered by their violation.  That approach could work well 
integrated with the coarser deployment of type systems to model 
purely syntactic convergence to Proposition roots.  On the other hand, 
separating out theta grids (qua semantic phenomena) from purely syntactic 
parse-trees might allow for more detailed description of theta-requirements.  
I will examine specific possible cases in the next subsection.    
`p`


`subsection.Defaults and Doubling in Theta Grids`
`p.
The term `q.theta role` is often used for a specific class of 
`q.thematic relations`/, with the distinguishing feature of the 
former being that they are `q.mandatory`/: some constituent 
must occupy that role for the verb-phrase to produce a complete 
idea.  Such essentiality is often (though not necessarily) 
manifested in the transposition of a subordinate phrases to 
an indirect object:

I gave a book to John.
I gave John a book.
I brought a book to John.
I brought John a book.

These are rough distinctions, however, which need a lot 
of work when tested against sentences in the wild. 
`p`


`p.
Consider `i.bring`/.  If we ignore ditransitive 
constructions, that verb seems to expect a phrase 
led by `i.for` or `i.to`/; or one of each:

I brought a book to John.
I brought a book for John.
I brought a book for John to his desk.

It might sound a little more natural to express 
() with a different verb, e.g. `q.I left a book for 
John on his desk`/, but I'll take () as admissible 
for now.
`p`


`p.
The details of `q.bring` evidently have two dimensions: a `i.destination` 
and a `i.recipient`/.  One does not usually state both explicitly, 
but this seems to because one or the other is inferred from context.  
In () [1], for example, the implication is of giving the book to John 
for his benefit; both a movement `i.to` someplace where John was, and a 
`q.transfer of ownership` (perhaps termporary) on his behalf.  The 
`i.to John` condenses a report of location and of recipience into 
one phrase: we infer the location as where John was when the 
event took place, and John as the beneficiary.  In (), the most 
likely reading for me is that the `i.location` role is played instead 
by wherever the present conversation is happening, which is (or might be) 
different where John is (or will be when he receives the book).  
Someone visiting John's parents when he isn't home could say () 
and be understood as planning to leave a book with the parents 
to give to John some time in the future. 
`p`


`p.
Conventionally, only phrases involving a beneficiary or recipient are 
candidates for transposition into an indirect pbject, which 
indeed is typically called `q.dative shift`/.  But there are plausible 
corner cases that reveal a more tangled relation between locative and benefactive:`footnote.
As `q.deep case`/, i.e., case-designations on a semantic plane which are not necessarily 
marked inflectionally. 
`footnote`  

I brought John a book for his sister.
I brought John a book and left it with his parents.
I brought your grandparents some food and left it in your fridge.
I brought your grandparents some food for your party. 
   
The `q.path` taken by some object transferred for someone's benefit 
can have multiple parts.  We might therefore read () [1] and () [4] 
as actually transposing an N:location role, `i.not` a recipient, 
because the direct object is actually an intermediate 
step: John is presumably intended to give the book to his 
sister, `q.finishing` the path; and `q.your grandparents` to 
bring the mentioned food to the listeners (() implies that 
for some reason the speaker could not bring the food to them directly).  
An alternative reading, however, is that () and () position 
the indirect object as a kind of `q.secondary` beneficiary, presumed cooperative 
enough to `q.accept` the direct object on the actual recipients' behalf.  
If we wanted to describe this role-variant, we might refer to it as 
the `i.facilitator`/, grammatically functioning as a special 
kind of beneficiary.  Note that the dative shift does not work 
if we talk about the facilitator's location directly:

* I brought John's room a book for his sister.    
* I brought your grandparent's house some food for your party. 

But these are OK:

I brought to John's room a book for his sister.    
I brought some food for your party to your grandparent's house.
`p`


`p.
In a variation, sometimes the beneficiary of a `q.bringing` is 
implied to be the speaker themselves; or even everyone 
involved in a conversation:

I brought a book to the beach.
John brought coffee and donuts!
I brought a book to the beach in case someone wants to read.

We hear () as a scenario where the speaker completes reading that book 
while at the beach.  In (), conversely, the beneficiary is 
open-ended; but we can still say that there is `i.something` playing 
that role, only as an abstract potentiality rather than something 
determinate: the occupants of that role are `q.spread out` not unlike 
in (), since by implication any listener could end up reading the 
book (likewise, () connotes that everyone is free to claim a donut and coffee). 
`p`


`p.
The fact that certain roles' occpants are not explicitly spelled out 
does not mean they are optional; we can argue instead that there 
are `q.defaults` inferred according to pragmatic conventions.  
With `i,bring`/, a reasonable summary is that 
`i.both` locative and benefactive deep-case roles are mandated.  
In (), for instance, even if we read `q.John` as a `q.facilitator` 
%-- playing a role similar enough to `i.recipient` to permit the dative 
shift %-- there is `i.also` a location-role, presumably occupied 
also by `q.John` as a proxy for whatever place he was when he 
received the book.   
`p`


`p.
On this analysis, theta grids are relieved of certain conventional 
`q.theta criteria`/: for instance, it appears that we can have 
participants playing two distinct roles (John is both location 
and recipient in ()) and also not-explicitly-filled roles (via 
defaults).  One can debate whether these possibilities substantially 
violate commonly-recognized criteria or not.  For instance, 
taking John as proxy for the place where he's at could be 
read as distinguishing him from place: `i.John` does not 
actually fulfill a location role.  Likewise, `q.default`/-occupied 
roles are still fulfilled.  Actual sentences can be seen as 
compressed versions of more elaborate formations which obey 
theta-criteria more rigorously, on a `q.deep structure` level.  
Such an analysis, however, would seem to remove any 
description of `i.how` defaults are obtained.  A more complete 
treatment might track closer to surface-level language, 
and use theta grids to notate mandtory arguments, but also 
interpretive protocols for when those role-occupants 
are not explicitly identified.  A framing for `i.bring`/, 
for instance, might stipulate that location and recipient 
roles are non-optional, with rules for inferring defaults 
when the location is not explicit (e.g., the place 
of the current conversation), or when the recipient 
is not stated (e.g., someone or everyone from among 
the current conversation-participants, including the current 
speaker), or when the recipient is introduced via a dative shift (skipping 
any mention of location).  Such rules would themselves be part of the 
theta grid.
`p`


`p.
If theta grids carry additional structure along these liues, it becomes 
harder to slide them seamlessly into type-convergence models, 
seemingly giving weight to the preference of theta grids being orthogonal 
to purely syntactic type-attribution.  On the other hand, some 
compelling analyses employ more detailed type theories to 
analyze phenomena related to thematic relations in general.  
[http://www.stergioschatzikyriakidis.com/uploads/1/0/3/6/10363759/mol-revision.pdf] 
For instance, Z. Luo and S. Chatzikyriakidis in [] 
document cases where the cognitive sense of an entity can 
switch from, e.g., institution to object or location 
(or other combinations of these three options) mid-sentence, 
but other cases where that fails.  One might relegate 
these variations to lexical idiosyncracies, but it is always better 
to provide semantic models that anticipate patterns of 
acceptability and inacceptability for systematic, rather than 
lexically ad-hoc reasons.  This can be a motivation for 
pursuing a liguistic type theory that extends well beyond 
minimal part-of-speech categories into levels of greater 
semantic precision.  
`p`


`p.
Theta role theory identifies a canonical list of important thematic 
relations, such as location and beneficiary, as well as 
(e.g.) `i.cause`/, `i.possessor`/, and `i.experiencer`/.  
These overlap with models of nouns being divided into 
various `q.ontological` categories, such as (to take a 
progressively refined chain) physical thing, living thing, 
animate thing, sentient thing, human being.  Conditions 
on a verb like `i.want` %-- its subject must have 
conscious awareness (with room for metaphoric interpretions 
like plants wanting water, where the literal meaning is closer 
to `q.need` %-- could be modeled as extra specificity on the 
attribution of the coarse type `q.noun` to the verb's subject, 
`i.or` as the presence of a theta grid that supplements 
purely syntactic Part of Speech labeling, imposing its 
pwn semantic requirements.  In some cases (such as `q.experiencer`/) 
the two subdivisions %-- those represented as `q.subtypes` and 
those proposed as criteria situated in a theta grid 
%-- may overlap.  However, I believe there are noticeable 
theoretical differences between the two approaches.  
As I remarked earlier, treating `q.ontological` variations 
among nouns (e.g., in terms of `q.mesotypes`/) as 
`i.subtypes`/, swapped in for the generic `q.noun` type 
in convergence/reduction, imports semantic considerations into 
otherwise purely-syntactic attribution rules, along the lines 
of V + N = P.`footnote.
This talk about `q.semantic` versus `q.purely syntactic` may sound 
problemmatic, because one may doubt on cognitive grounds whether 
semantics and syntax are ever truly separable.  However, the basic 
idea of type-checking over phrase structure proposes that there is a 
level of grammatical-category attribution which only 
minimally incorporates semantic information, and presents 
constrainst on well-formedness that can be expressed solely 
through abstract Part of Speech categories without checking 
semantic details except insofar as these play a role 
in assigning parts of speech to begin with (cf. the adectival 
status of `q.baseball` in e.g. `q.baseball bat`/).  I do 
`i.not` claim that cognitive processes inferring 
parts of speech can indeed be separated from matters of 
semantics; instead the phrase-hierarchy type-checking is an 
abstract reconstruction of processing constraints 
extracted (perhaps retroactively) from overall 
sentence understanding.      
`footnote`  Via theta grids, conversely, semantic-role 
constraints are modeled separately from type-convergence rules 
such as substituting Proposition type for completed verb-phrases, 
in the context of superordinate phrases.  Syntactic and 
semantic well-formed-ness rules exist in separate registers 
and (in logical reconstruction, if not actual semiotic cognition) 
function independently to filter dubious constructions 
(or, more likely, trigger interpretive resolutions when 
literal meanings appear to violate conventions).  
I think these are different theoretical systems, 
although the differences might be an artifact of theoretical 
preferences %-- that is, perhaps they are alternate 
tactics for analyzing the same cognitive phenomena.  
Maybe, however, one or another representational 
architecture would indeed be more effective at 
modeling the underlying cognitive processes 
involved with understanding sentences. 
`p`



`subsection.Optional and Mandatory Thematic Relations`
`p.
The notion that theta roles cover `i.necessary` verb-details 
entails, absent further qualification, that we can 
straightforwardly distinguish optional from 
mandatory roles.  The possibility of defaults compicates 
that assumption, because we need to distinguish 
optional roles from mandatory but not-explicitly-characterized 
ones.  Consider  

I brought a book.

The possibility of () shows that `i.bring` can be just 
transitive (not ditransitive or `q.tritransitive`/) on the surface, 
but via defaults we can read () as content-wise equivalent to 

I brought a book here for myself to read

wherein we see that both a location-role and a recipient-role are indeed 
fulfilled.  A receipient-role, which appears mandated vis-a-vis 
`i.bring`/, seems optional elsewhere:

I left some treats in your purse for the dog.
I put some treats in your purse for the dog.

These sentences would be complete, `i.prima facie`/, without `q.for the dog`/.  
But optional or no, a dative transpose seems possible at least for (), 
whereas a `q.bring` version (here we've been primed to expect dative 
shift) is actually problemmatic:

? I brought the dog some treats in your purse.
I left the dog some treats in your purse.
  
The awkwardness in () would seem to be that `i.in your purse`/, 
event if a statement of location, is somehow not the right 
`q.kind` of location.  The only way () might be heard 
comfortably would be akin to `q.I brought some treats `i.in this bag`/`/, 
wherein the bag is not that actual destination for the direct object but 
more of an instrumentive, a means to transport said object.  
The cognitive dissonanace is that something used as a nehicle for 
transporting some goods is not typically perceived as a 
destination where those goods are dropped off.  This feels like an 
extra-linguistic regularity of situational construal rather 
than any semantic restriction.  Nevertheless, it separates out 
`i.bring` from, say, `i.put`/, which seems to be freer in this 
regard: to `q.put` does not imply some extended spatial 
path with the final location as a destination, even if 
there is `i.some` degree of purposeful movement.   
`p`


`p.
A tempting hypothesis is that dative shift only works with mandatory 
arguments %-- making it a plausible test of optionality %-- but 
() looks to me like a counter-example.  Since optionality is 
not the same as defaults, consider shorter versions of ()

I left some treats in your purse.
I'm leaving some treats.

Given (), `q.leave` might be transitive but not ditransitive 
on a surface level, but perhaps there is an implicit `q.here` 
(whatever the site of the conversation) ensuring that 
there is always an occupied location-role.  In (), then, 
we might speculate that a similar `q.here` default supplies 
the `i.actual` location-argument, such that `i.in your purse` 
is actually a supplemental detail.  The important information 
in () would seem to be that the speaker intends the dog to 
benefit from the treats sometime in the future; the main 
functional detail is that the treats are somewhere 
conventiently accessible (it so happens they're in the purse, 
but that's less essential).  There are, in other words, two 
conceptually different locations evoked by the sentence, 
a kind of functionally construed `q.here` versus 
a narrower `i.in the purse` (albeit the latter being 
contained in the former).  In (), however, there seems 
to be no comparable bifurcation of the location-dimension; 
we don't sense a conceptual role for a generic `q.here` 
over and above the specific `i.in your purse`/.   
`p`


`p.
Perhaps what's going on is that the dative form in () 
shifts the sentence's emphasis away from the description of a 
spatial configuration and toward a functional `q.gestalt`/, 
foregrounding expectation that the dog gets the treats.  
Conversely, () cognitively attends specifically to the 
spatial positioning of the treats in the bag.  The spatial 
details are thematically marginalized in () because that 
utterance derives from an interest in the practical 
scenario of the dog getting the treats, within which 
those treats' precise spatial position is tangential.  
Such contrast in attention-distribution apparently 
governs how a dative shift works for () but not ().  
The verb `q.put` appears to foreground the conveyed  
spatial containment-relation more tightly than with 
`i.leave`/; the latter, but not the former, tolerates a 
ditransitive construction which perhaps imports an 
implicit location-default (an ambient `q.here`/) and 
relegates the actually stated location to a secondary 
adjunct.  Or perhaps we actually read the shift 
in () as, indeed, transposing an optional detail to a 
non-prepositional indirect object, basing a reading 
of that shift's permissibility on the same 
cognitive factors. 
`p`


`p.
There seem to be few, if any, cases where a dative shift 
transposes any argument `i.without` a recipient role.  
Examples like 

I gave John a book.
I gave a book to John.

intimate that the indirect object can derive from a `q.to` clause [phr], 
but conventional wisdom is that these are benefactives 
in disguise.  The act of giving `q.transfers ownership` to a recipient, 
and while that process often involves physical movement, it is the 
beneficial intent that the verb emphasis, such that it may be 
used in contexts precluding physical movement; whereas other 
verbs without the same benefactive connotation do not accept dative shifts:

She left her daughter the house (in her will).
I deposited the book with John.
* I deposited John the book.

Examples such as () and () involving `q.facilitators` might appear to be dative shifts 
that are actually locative, but (although I am not definitively endorsing 
this reading) we can say that the facilitator is actually a variant 
of the dative, and only secondarily a locative.      
`p`


`p.
Accepting the language of `q.tyoe coercion` %-- which, if combined with theta-role 
models, would characterize how nouns are interpreted when their ordinary meanings 
are incompatible with thematic roles they play in some verb's theta grid  
%-- such examples as `q.go to Grandma` are analyzed as `q.coercing` Grandma to a 
place.  How that works in practice can vary, since (see ()) there are figurative 
uses (going to the press might not be literally visiting a newspaper building) 
plus defaults and proxying (cf. the question of whether `q.coercing` a person 
to a place implies the person playing two theta-roles at once, or whether 
the person and the place are, better, theorized as conceptually separate).  
But `q.type coercion` terminology implies that formal type theory can 
potentially provide systematic descriptions of these various interpretic 
complications, rather than relegating them to lexical particularities 
and/or extralinguistic situationalism and `q.background knowledge`/.  
Theoretical questions %-- to the degree that we seek syntactic and 
semantic, rather than cognitive/extra-linguistic models %-- 
would include, for example, how to charactize the inacceptability of phrases 
which do not appear to repsect relevant contextual framing; and how to model the coercion 
effects wherein contextual framing imposes restrictions on interpretation that 
would not exist in general.  For instance, `q.visited grandma` is narrower than just 
`q.spent time with` or `q.chatted with` (or even `q.visited with`/) and also narower 
than similar designations of place:  

We visited with grandma when she came here last week 
* we visited grandma when she came here last week
We drove by grandma on the way to school.  Later we learned she wasn't home.
* we visited grandma but she wasn't home.

`q.Visit` appears to coerce `q.Grandma` to a place (e.g., her home), but with the 
stipulation or narrowing that she must actually be there; thus `q.Grandma` is not 
just a metonymic substitute for `q.Grandma's home` the way it could be with 
`q.drove by`/, see `q.we drove by the Mets on the way to the airport` 
(referring to the baseball stadium where they play); or `q.we walked past the dean to get to your office` 
(referring to the dean's office; contrast `q.we sneaked past the dean to get to your office`/). 
`q.Visit` appears to impose a more granular and information-bearing contextual frame than 
`q.drive by`/, and likeise `q.sneak` versus `q.walk`/.
`p`

`p.
Such framing effects can operate on different levesl: among the coarsest grammatical categories, 
so that the only explicit interpretive requirement is that words are treated as nouns, verbs, 
adjectives, and so on relative to the proper parse-graph (`q.baseball` becomes an adjective in 
`q.baseball bat`/, etc.); at an intermediate `q.ontological` level differentating places from 
objects, inanimate objects from sentient ones, etc. (you can only `q.sneak past` something 
capable of observing and of forming opinions); and at a fine-grained lexical level 
(see `q.no-trump` vis-a-vis card games).  To what extent should we consider the cognitive 
mechanisms behind contextual framing as similar across all three levels, versus stipulating 
that each level should be theorized separately?
`p`

`p.
This question has two dimensions: whether it is most appropriate or fortuitous to `i.model` different levels 
of contextual framing as similar or distinct; and whether the actual cognitive/neurological processes 
carried out in the mind are similar or distinct.  These dimensions are somewhat separate, because in the 
absense of neurocognitive evidence it is a matter of speculation to what degree framing obeys similar 
intellectual mechanisms at different levels.  As such, preferring to unify the levels under a single 
theoretical umbrella depends more on which models feel like they have the most explanatory merit or 
structural propriety for further research/analysis.`footnote.
Apart from neurological data, computational evidence that NLP engines which employ similar or, conversely, divergent algorithms for computing within contextual frames at different levels might also give empirical feedback.  I am not aware however of analyses which have compared NLP technology along such lines.
`footnote`
`p`

`p.
In general, `q.type-level` beta-reduction seems more compatible with assumptions that contextual 
framing is properly studied across multiple scales of granularity.  This is because beta-reduction 
as `q.type checking` works essentially the same irregardless of the paucity or numerosity of types 
over which nodes can quantify.  Moreover, there seems to be a gradation between `q.macro-types` 
(grammatical categories) and `q.meso-types` (ontological regions, in effect): consider singular/plural, 
or mass/count.  To what extent are mass and count nouns distinct grammatical categories, or are 
their differences more a semantic matter driven by situational differences 
(perceiving/experiencing/cognitizing some extent as mass or count representing an pragmatic 
stance toward those surroundings, motivated by extra-linguistic considerations).  Leveraging beta-reduction 
style models to span different levels of contextual granularity (of course the notion and specific details 
of `q.beta-reduction` don't need to be explicitly stated as such) 
helps acknolwedge that it is hard to draw a crisp line between the kind of 
contextual framing imposed by grammatical and by ontological categories.
`p`

`p.
On the other hand, I do not seek to foreclose analyses which highlight differences 
between context-framing levels.  The rationale for modeling context 
(in the relevant sense) via beta-reduction is that such an analogy 
implies a reasonably formal/deterministic process which concludes that only 
certain interpretations of a phrase's constituents aggregate to a coherent whole.  
`q.Visit the leadership group` only makes sense if we can read the group as a `i.place` 
(e.g., where they habitually gather %-- ruling out, say, soliciting opinions by 
email or holding a conference call), with place-ness being part (though only part) 
of the conceptual matrix through which we figure the referent and signified for, 
e.g., `q.leadership group` as a phrase.  Moreover, 
context-framing constraints propagate from nested phrases outward: 

I visited the leadership group and took a cab back. [no need to specify back from where]
? I consulted with the leadership group and took a cab back. [the second half of the sentence supplies new information not presumptively included in the first part]
* I studied the leadership group and took a cab back. 
? I visited the newspaper yesterday and bought a copy today [plausible for someone who might have some special interest in learning about some newspaper, e.g. a prospective employee].


Such propagation effects imply that types/categories need to `q.fold up`/, kind of by analogy to a cardboard 
box that can lie flat only when the flaps are collapsed in the right directions and order.  
Novice box-folders tend to backtrack before getting the sequence right.  
By analogy, perhaps our minds scan through diverse `q.folding patterns` measuring whether phrases 
collapse to a lucid proposition given specific lexical and part-of-speech interpretations of 
individual words or world-like phrases.  Computer programming languages work the 
same way when it comes to resolving overloaded procedures in a generic-programming context (see section 1).
`p`

`p.
This all might seem like a lot of theoretical content to make the fairly obvious point that 
phrase-heirarchies cannot be assembled (or disassembled) in an incoherent manner.  
Semantic and situational (as well as syntactic) reasonableness eliminates many hypothetical parse-trees, 
hopefully leaving only one still standing.  Notice, though, that insofar as contextual 
constraints on phrase-formation operate at differerent granularity levels, the `q.elimination` is 
driven by multiple levels concurrently (or at least each contributing their own qualifications); 
we therefore demand a framework that studies how the different levels interoperate.  
In other words, assessing candidate parse-interpretations is a dynamic process 
steered by different granularity levels (perhaps in sequence, perhaps interleaved, perhaps cooperating); 
the propagatory facets of beta-reduction perhaps make this a more intuitive model for 
such dynamic processing than `q.static` constituency diagrams, such as those of X-bar theory.  
`p`

`p.
Furthermore, elucidating a sentence's parse-graph is only one step in the comprehension process, 
and addressees still need to complete lexical details and resolve references/anaphora.  
If we (perhaps as a simplifying abstraction) view parsing and overall comprehension as two 
successive stages, the amount of information yielded by the first phase can vary from case to case.  
For instance, in `q.visit the newspaper` we have data to the effect that `q.the newspaper` must 
be read as a place-designation, from which it naturally follows that this phrase designates a 
building/location the paper occupies.
`p`

`p.
If we picture parsing as `q.beta-reduction`/, the idea would be to treat the graph 
(one which is tree-like, but may contain lateral edges as well such as pronouns-to-antecedents) 
as comprised of nodes `q.labeled` with categorical or type attributions that bear at 
least some information.  Only certain such `q.labeling` would survive the eliminative process 
whereby mismatched part-of-speech (or finer) attributions fail to fold up to a coherent proposition-like whole.  
So the labeling serves that eliminative purpose.  But simultaneously, the labeling produces information 
that remains in effect during subsequent comprehension: e.g., data such as `q.the newspaper` needing 
to reference a place (and not, say, an object).  The more granular the available set of 
node `q.labels`/, the more information leaks out from the first phase onto the second.
`p`

`p.
In short, the processes which converge on our realization that a certain parse-graph is correct for 
a given sentence also result in criteria attached to individual words or phrases that then serve as 
a starting point for deciding what the sentence actually `i.means`/.  More to the point, the 
`i.quantity` of this data would seem to be larger or smaller from sentence to another.  
In some cases, we have lexical and/or morphological evidence of singular/plural or mass/count.  
In other sentences, `q.deep case` or semantic-role considerations add extra details that are prerequisite 
for parse-graphs being admissible, thereby yielding a more granular array of data left over from the 
parsing `q.stage`/.  A useful model of these phenomena should thereby present a structural 
framework which adapts to diffrent amounts of information being provided based on different 
levels of specificity with respect to what content becomes associated with graph-node.  
This works with a beta-reduction account because the reduction rules themselves adapt to the cardinality of sets over which node-labels quantify.  For some sentences only rudimentary part-of-speech constraints 
have any effect; for others, there is explicit contextual framing at an intermediate 
(`q.meso-type` or thematic-relation) level (e.g., how `q.assume` implies a sentient subject 
and a proposition-like object).  Arguably, in still further cases there are lexical 
considerations that impose even tighter contexts 
(and thus more detailed after-parse information), 
since some words force a specific topic on their neighbors (see `q.no-trump defense`/).       
`p`

`p.
Beta-reduction thereby becomes a useful metaphor and structural precis; it doesn't need 
to be a rigorous formal simulation of linguistic processing (as compared to the case with 
implementing compilers for computer languages, which have a mathematical substrate: in the 
case of human language we do not need to picture the mind itself as some sort of lambda-calculus machine).  
However, the `q.type-based` account of beta reduction captures only partial desiderata 
toward understanding sentences as a whole; in this sense the theories differs from ones 
I outlined earlier in the section, based on (e.g.) Category Theory or Predicate Logic, 
wherein the entirety of meaning (or at least of semantics, allowing for pragmatic resolving of 
deictic references and the like) is computed via a certain combinatorial process (for which beta-reduction would be a reasonable synopsis).  As a semantic theory the account presented thus far obviously then goes 
less far than those others.
`p`

`p.
Beta reduction models how parsing constraints narrow the space of plausible parse-graphs 
to a few (potentially superimposed) which, assuming an unambiguous sentence, either yield 
similar interpretations for the overall sentence (recall the `q.look out` and `q.climb up` 
examples) or are subject to additional selective possibilities so as to converge on a single reading.  
I have not addressed, however, the path which our minds take toward understanding a sentence 
in full detail, which would in general exhibit a greater degree of comprehension 
than parsing alone.  I might have a reasonable chance at guessing the syntactic 
properties of a sentence containing unfamilair words %-- perhaps aided by morphological observations, such as gerunds on verbs or plurals on nounds %-- but remain puzzled as to what the whole thing actually means.  
There is obviously `i.some` gap between syntax and semantics/pragmatics.
`p`

`p.
To explore it, I will start with the distinction between `q.theta roles` and `q.thematic relations` 
which I touched on earlier.  We assume that elements of a sentence can be classified in terms of the 
details they contribute to a verb %-- i.e., through the verb we profile some event, state, or process; 
and surrounding words add information so as to characterize that events/states/processes more fully, 
reletive to how the speaker perceives them.  The `q.TAME` criteria cover various facets of verb detail: 
tense and aspect concern termporal matters, whereas evidentials report on how the speaker came to 
observe or believe the event/state/process signified.  These represent one layer of 
specifity pertientn to the verb's usage in context.
`p`

`p.
Subject, object, and direct object are a (probably) different layer or `q.zone`/.  They appear 
to be intrinsic to the verb, in that %-- modulo competing word-senses, e.g. `q.climb a mountain` 
versus intransitive `q.climb` qua activity %-- verbs' meanings carry built-in expectations 
of subjects (even if `q.null` subjects like `q.it's raining`/, or commands' addressees) 
and, if applicable, direct then indirect objects.  To `i.give`/, say, connotes a conceptual 
matrix which demands the fulfillment of subject (the giver), direct object (the thing given), 
and indirect object (recipient).  Absense of any of these forces us to read the constituents 
as obvious in context and therefore not explicitly stated (in `q.give to charity` it is understood 
that one is giving money).  To `q.introduce` implies a ditransitive structure separating an 
introducer, someone/thing introduced, and some sort of audience; absense of some part forces us 
either to read it contextually or to re-evaluate the lexical details, perhaps concluding that 
`q.introduced` is being employed in just the transitive sense (as in `q.she introduced the speaker`/).  
Even here, though, one can debate whether the introduction's `q.audience` is unstated but 
implicit (`q.introduce a speaker` implies that there is a group of people whom the speaker 
will soon address) or whether there are two basically distinct word-senses for `q.introduce`/, one 
of which has an indirect object and one which does not.  In some cases the different-word-sense 
analysis is more straightforward: consider `q.I drew him` versus `q.I drew him a picture` 
(it is harder to read the `q.single-` transitive `q.draw` as actually a ditransitive verb 
with an indirect object understood by default when not stated, as compared to, say, `q.introduce`/).
`p`

`p.
These subject/object considerations can be differentiated from TAME in that the former expectations 
are generically associated with the verb, in an abstract way that can be specified in a dictionary, 
whereas TAME depends on dialogic context.  It is an `i.instance` or `i.token` of a verb that has 
temporal bounding/specificity (or, alternatively, open-endedness) and which permits 
different evidential markers depending on the speaker's epistemic position.  
By contrast, a verb's property of requiring, say, a direct object is not situation-specific 
(at least insofar as we are inclined to classify the optionality of a direct obejct in some 
cases as the verb being partially polysemous, rather than as a single meaning which can get 
grounded sometimes with a direct object and sometimes without).  The contrast between TAME and 
`q.theta roles` may not be entirely transparent, but it seems reasonable to argue that 
TAME data are `i.only` operative when we concern a specific grounded 
verb-instance, whereas `q.theta roles` are abstract slots built in to the meaning of a verb.
`p`

`p.
This language implicitly assumes that we can distinguish theta roles (where are available 
for morphosyntactic/inflectional marking) from more general `q.thematic relations`/.  In English, 
of course, the indirect object can be introduced via a phrase (`q.I gave the book to him`/) 
but also positionally, implying the presence of an (unmarked) case (`q.I gave him the book`/).  
The second form is a short-cut which suggests (and is possible because) a certain indirect-object 
relation is canonically associated with the corresponding verbs.  Other such relations are 
less conventional and therefore do not work except when phrasally articulated:

I opened the bottle with a corkscrew.
* I opened corkscrew the bottle.
? I corkscrewed open the bottle.
I signed the book for him.
? I signed him the book.

In theories that differentiate theta roles from thematic relations 
(and this is not ubiquitous), the contrast is apparently driven by whether the 
relevant semantic roles are `i.necessary` for the verb to yield a complete idea.  
Thus `q.I sent him the book` could be followed by further information (yesterday; by post; 
for you; from Manhattan) but the sentence is complete (enough to be coherent) by itself.  
So we might distinghuish content which is necessary vis-a-vis the verb `i.instance` (TAME) 
from that necessary by lights of the verb's overall meaning (the cases it `i.must` support) 
and also from that which is somehow `q.optional`/.  I suggest this is analogous to a system of 
`q.zones` that organize sentence material in terms of their mandate's extent when fully grounding 
the relevant verb.  TAME details might be called the `q.innermost` zone because these are most 
likely to be marked on the verb itself (e.g., through conjugation patterns) whereas theta roles, 
if they are marked at all (as opposed to introduced via residual phrases) would depending on 
declensions on nouns, not the actual verbs.  `q.Optional` extra descriptions, such as 
where something happened, or how (etc.) act as a kind of `q.outermost` zone.
`p`

`p.
Such a tripartite breakdown may be a good start, but consider again a question I mentioned earlier, 
namely the status of place nouns as the destination in verb of motion, such as 
`q.I climbed up to the roof`/.  Should we read `q.to the roof` as in a sense a 
direct object %-- an answer to the question `q.where did you climb?` -- or is 
`q.I climbed up` a complete thought in and of itself?  In short, 
does `q.to the roof` here belong to the outermost zome (optional) or to an intermediary zone?
`p`

`p.
Arguably, this kind of question is relative to the foci of the person observing the verb's 
action (or inaction).  Suppose 

She turned onto Atlantic Avenue.

Presumably the speaker is reporting the action of a driver (or maybe a bike rider, perhaps a pedestrian) 
who is now following Atlantic Avenue (but was not previously).  The interest seems to be in where that 
person is going now; by extension, then, on the practical ramification of the fact of making that 
turn (she's going in a different direction than if she'd stayed straight).  The specific 
seconds where tge actual turning occurred are less centralized; our mental attention is zoomed outward somewhat.  
These attitudinal details appear to reinforce the reading that `q.turn onto` is functioning as a 
compound verb, and `q.Atlantic Avenue` as a direct object (insofar as `q.turn onto` evinces a 
conceptual matrix that requires specifying a new direction and location than before).
`p`

`p.
Conversely, suppose we read (*) as if the verb itself were just `q.turn`/, and 
then `q.onto Atlantic Avenue` becomes supplemental but inessential detailing.  
This gloss is only reasonable if the speaker's attention were zoomed in more 
narrowly onto the act of turning.  Compare a statement about some bike rider:

He fell onto a railing, bruising his shoulder.
He fell, bruising his shoulder.

In the second case `q.fall` is the main event, and the speaker apparently wants to explain 
how that mishap affected the rider in hurting his shoulder.  Whereas [] pans attention out 
slightly to emphasize that the relevant event was not just a falling, but `i.falling onto` 
something (the fact that it was a presumably-hard railing implied to be partly 
why his shoulder got injured).  Here `q.the railing` could be read as a direct object 
for `q.fall onto` or, alternatively, `q.onto the railing` as the 
locative container for an intransitive `q.fall`/.
`p`

`p.
Examples like these imply that questions over whether certain details are `q.essential` 
to a verb depend on the speakers' point of view.  That's not 
necessarily a bad outcome, but it complicates the idea that 
`q.intermediate zone` semantic roles are intrinsic to the verb's 
(in its relevant word-sense) `q.dictionary meaning`/, in contrast to 
tense/aspect/mode/evidentiality which come into play with the specificity 
of the verb's `i.grounding` (it is only when instantiated that 
a verb suggests some temporal extent, say).  
`p`

`p.
Along similar lines, observe also that inflectional or positional marking reinforces 
conceptual essentiality %-- in English, details have to be supplied through (often preposition-led) 
phrases except for canonical relations such as `q.give` and its indirect object 
(`q.I gave him the book`/).  But conceptual nonoptionality by itself does not guarantee 
that compressed non-phrasal constructions are permissable.  For instance, 
suppose someone says `q.I brought K'eyush to the store` (so he could select his own 
treats/because they allow dogs/because the dog-sitter's on vacation or whatever).  
Now certainly no English speaker would balk at someone saying just `q.I brought K'eyush`/, 
but we should probably read that as simply implying an unstated location/indirect-object, 
as in by default `q.I brought K'eyush `i.here`/`/.  As I argued above, the verb `q.bring`/, 
that is, probably always has a 3-part conceptual matrix where the `q.location` part 
(whatever place the direct object is brought `i.to`/) defaults to the current 
place where the conversation is happening (similar to examples like 
`q.I brought coffee`/, or `q.there's a lot of people`/, which 
in turn we take to mean a lot of people `here`/).
`p`

`p.
But despite that conceptual mandate (the location/indirect object must be present) 
we may not transpose sentences by analogy to `q.I gave him the book`/:

* I brought the store K'eyush

... although the compressed form works sometimes:

I brought K'eyush some treats.
I brought him a book.

Presumably these are admissible because the recipient is not only a `i.location` but also a `i.beneficiary`/.  
If anything, though, the question of on whose behalf something is brought seems 
less non-eliminable than `i.where` it was brought.  Someone can certianly say `q.I brought some treats`/, 
implying (as I've argued) they've brough the treats `i.here`/; and 
that is a complete idea, even though they could well add on `q.for K'eyush`/.  
`p`

[https://gawron.sdsu.edu/syntax/course_core/final_13/theta_grids.pdf]

`p.
The salient conceptual matrix for `q.bring` seems to be `q.`i.someone` brings `i.somthing` to `i.some place`/` 
but, on reflection, perhaps we almost always infer a notion of beneficiary 
or recipient, even if unstated: `q.I've brought coffee` 
implies `q.cofee for us/everyone (to drink)` unless the context compels 
a reading where they brought the coffee only for themselves (as in `q.what did you bring for your lunch?`/).  
Indeed, the `q.recipient` role seems entrenched to the point where that thematic relation, 
and not location per se, gets slotted in for the condensed construction:

I brought the house some dinner (i.e., dinner `i.for` the people `i.in` the house)
I brought paint for the house.
* I brought the house paint.

Of course such data presumably lie behind the terminology `i.dative` shift.  By analogy 
to a person-to-place coercion in `q.to Grandma`/, the dative criterion compels a 
type-coercion to the role of `q.beneficiary` if the indirect object does not 
conceptually work, sans some intrerpretation as recipient of the `i.direct` object.
In () `q.the house` must be read as a sentient beneficiary and therefore we take it as 
obliquely referring to people `i.in` the house.  It is not enough for there to be 
a reading where the recipient somehow benefits or is improved, 
as with bringing paint; we cannot transpose (2) to (3) in parrallel to these:

I brought some paint for our young artist.
I brought our young artist some paint.

The recipient in () and () can presumably `i.experience` the benefits accrued by 
whatever is brought, whereas `q.the house` might look better with a 
fresh coat of paint but would not experience itself as such.
`p`

`p.
Hance I've argued that `q.bring` has a 4-part conceptual grid 
with a subject and direct object and then `i.two` essential further 
roles; `i.place` and `i.recipient`/.  Notice that both of these roles 
might be ineliminable; examples where notions of place are absent seem 
to be figurative metaphors rather than down-to-earth instances of a `q.bring` schema:

You brought us all happiness
Exercise brought him good health
Fate brought him good luck

These seem to play off of a metaphor of one's emotions or selfhood as a `q.place` %-- 
perhaps figured as an interior, spiritual location, or perhaps as a 
target/destination %-- rather than removing place from the schema entirely.  See:

I was in a dark place.
I'm in a better place now.
At the end of this road lies sorrow.
I'm on my way to happiness.

Assuming both `i.recipient` and `i.place` are intrinsic parts of the 
`q.bring` schema, then it makes sense that the `q.brought K'eyush treats` pattern 
would be the one marked by word order rather than a nested clause, 
because the `q.place` component could be inferred from context as either the setting 
for the current dialog and/or wherever the recipient is/was.  
There is an obvious default of `q.here` on the location slot but no 
similarly obvious default for the recipient slot.
`p`

`p.
Here then, finally, I can return to questions I posed at the start of this 
subsection: why does the dative shift appear to be an almost unique 
transposition in English, where a phrase supplying a 
benefactive role (but rarely, perhaps never, others) can move 
to an indirect-object slot?  In verbs with notions of both 
recipients and locations (`i.bring`/, `i.give`/, `i.send`/, etc.) the 
possibilities for unnamed defaults are evidently greater `visavis; the 
latter than the former; that alone would warrant an economizing convention 
where the recipient is dispatched concisely, right after the verb.  
There are many situations where a recipient, but not a location, 
must be explicitly stated; far fewer the other way around 
(as in `q.I brought a book to the park`/).  Observe that 
the dative shift is probably forbidden when both subordinates 
are needed:

I brought a book for John to his desk
* I brought John a book to his desk

So the transpose only really works when the recipient is 
explicit and the location inferred by default; in which 
case it is economical to compress the recipient-statement 
into a small an area as possible.  Presumably, 
conventions evolved to restrict other deep-case roles 
from undergoing a comparable shift so as to avoid 
confusion about the thematic status of an indirect 
object.  We are primed to impose a `q.benefactive` 
interpretation on whatever is enountered in an 
indirect-object slot.  
`p`

`p.
More to the point, there still may be supplemental information 
which the speaker intends to include.  After a dative 
shift, the thetic `q.portion` of the verb's detailing 
%-- i.e., the slots for subject, direct object, and 
indirect object, which cover semantically intrinsic 
roles prerequisite for a complete idea %-- is finalized, 
leaving open the possibility of further elaboration 
in the rest of the sentence.  When processing sentences 
that we hear, the syntagmatic boundary %-- `q.syntagmatic 
in the sense 
of language's structural plane, considered not only as a 
static parse-tree but as an unfolding, dynamic process 
%-- between the `q.theta grid` and more general thematic 
relations for a verb helps organize our cognitive 
reception.  That boundary marks the transition from filling 
in generic theta details pre-anticipated by a verb's 
abstract meaning, to parsing thematic relations 
that are more situation-specific.
`p`


`subsection.Verb Detailing and Syntagmatic Zones`
`p.
Although English verbs are at most ditransitive (in terms of `q.compressed` theta 
positions) their theta grids could have more than there elements, allowing 
for defaults and/or doubling.  This is hardly an original claim; 
I'm not trying to make a big deal about the existence of 4-part grids or tendencies guiding when 
semantic roles' participants can be introduced via marked positions (generically the indirect object) 
rather than prepositional phrases (since I'm only considering English I won't 
address case marking via morphology or inflection, but of course where those are present 
we could extend beyond positional marking alone).  What I want to emphasize instead 
is how these sorts of examples complicate intuitions that theta roles are distinguished 
from `q.optional` thematic relations in terms of conceptual requirements for a complete 
idea, and/or in terms of transpositions from preopositional clauses to positional marking.  
`p`


`p.
The notion that some thematic relations are essential and some aren't evidently derives 
from our intuition that a proper verb-construction can yield a complete idea, even if 
there also exist plenty of options for refining it.  So `q.I brought coffee` is 
(arguably) a coherent proposition, whereas `q.I brought coffee for everyone` adds more detail 
but has some content which is not absolutely necessarily, at least if logical satisfiability 
is the main criteria (we can strip sentences down to the minimalest core having 
identifiable truth conditions).  Of course, the truth conditions of 
`q.I brought coffee for everyone` and `q.I brought coffee for the boss` are different, 
but we might say that both sentences have an overlapping core; `q.I brought coffee` by itself 
does indeed have determinate truth-conditions (basically, if the speaker can show the dark liquid, 
they're telling the truth).  The `i.recipient` and `i.location` roles may still be in effect, 
but with defaults: bringing coffee (barring some discourse to the contraey) `i.here` 
and `i.for everyone`/.
`p`


`p.
All that being said, however, looking for `q.complete ideas` may not be enough once we factor 
in dialog context.  We could have an exchange like this:

I brought some cold beer.
 You sure it's still cold?
 I brought the beer in an ice-chest cooler.

The `q.in an ice-chest cooler` specification is in some sense 
`q.inessential` (because `i.how` the bringing was enacted %-- the means or vehicle %-- is not part 
of the perhaps four-part schema that is conceptually `i.necessary` for `i.bring`/).  In context, 
however, the other person(s) already knows the speaker had brought the beer, so it is really only 
that emendation that introduces new content.  Since the whole point of () is to report that the 
beers are staying cold, it seems counterintuitive to propose that the key phrase carrying that 
detail (`q.in an ice-chest cooler`/) is relatively less important.  
Assuming we read that phrase as a `q.deep-case` instrumentive, it seems that in this specific 
context the `i.how` of `q.bring` is no less significant than the `i.where` and `i.for whom`/.
`p`

`p.
To unpack these issues, we might say that certain thematic relations are `q.situationally` 
essential; i.e., that, against the backdrop of the specific situation which the speaker 
seeks to emphasize, certain participants in the overall verb-detail complex are especially 
important.  But this is situation-specific, rather than a general phenomenon that could be 
described dictionary-like.  Such is a distinct notion of essentiality, divergent both from 
details that are unavoidable for any verb-grounding (i.e., the TAME facets) and from the 
schematic status of conceptual matrices that are supported by a verb in general.  
Semantic roles that are schematically optional might nonetheless be intrinsic to 
a sentence's purpose in its specific conversational context.
`p`


`p.
Overall, then, the idea of an `q.intermediate zone` %-- `visavis; the binding of words and phrases 
that add information to the profiled verb %-- actually seems to span multiple `q.layers`/: constituents 
that are explicitly marked (e.g., as subject, direct object, or indirect object); those that are 
schematically intrinsic to the verb-sense and therefore must be present (albeit allowing for `q.defaults`/) 
even if there is no way to introduce them except via supplemental (typically prepositional) phrases; 
and details that are `q.situationally` intrinsic to the speaker's intent even if they would be deemed 
optional on more generic schematic/dictionary conceptualizations alone.  These various genrea of 
semantic roles and/or markings `q.propagate` from the verb outward (where inflectional variation 
like `q.brought` as past tense represent the innermost layer of detailing, at least 
vis-a-vis how it is grammaticalized, and supplemental phrases that seem to be tacked on to sentences 
as after-thoughts comprising the outermost layer).
`p`

`p.
Returning to `q.beta-reduction modulo topology`/, then, this demarcation of different 
role `q.zones` add structure to the parse-graphs over which beta-reductions fold up.  
Phrases belong to various zones, in ways that are not apparent from part-of-speech 
attributions alone.  For example, in `q.I heard that you brought treats from home for K'eyush in your purse`/, 
the `q.I heard that` phrase connects to the verb as an evidential, whereas `q.for K'eyush` is part 
of `q.bring`/'s definitional conceptual schema, and `q.in your purse` is effectively instrumentive 
and supplemental (and `q.from home` the equivalent of ablative case, maybe?), except for situation-specific 
contexts such as the cooler for the cold beer, where seemingly-residual `q.deep cases` (ablative, instrumentive, etc.) 
are atypically foregrounded.  Although structurally we can still employ the paradigm wherein 
types and/or grammatical categories (at some level of granularity) beta-reduce up from leaves to roots, 
we now have further parameters insofar as now specific phrases (subtrees) %-- and 
in some cases individual words/nodes %-- can be classified in terms 
of their semantic role and its `q.zone` status.
`p`

`p.
Such `q.zones` are then one step beyond the a bare-bones type-level beta reduction.  
I said before that I wanted to address how we can get from beta-reduction as `q.type-checking` for 
parse-graphs to actual sentence-meanings, given that (unlike possible-world semantics, say) 
I am not assuming that such meaning actually falls out of some computation.  
Notions of type-coercion represent information `q.leaking` from the parse `q.phase` to a second 
`q.comprehension` phase.  `q.Zone` patterns separating out different types of semantic 
roles embody a differernt source of structure to help define processing and/or 
cognitive operations folling the gap between the two phases.
`p`

  ---

`p.
Given a theory of `q.verb detail zones`/, we can begin to consider the thought-processes 
involved as a person decides precisely how to formulate a sentence while they're speaking 
(by extension, the ideas which addressees must reverse engineer, or decode in 
revrswe, to reconstruct speakers' intensions from their projection 
onto purely linguistic formations).  
`p`

`p.
It is at the speaker's discretion to decide how much or how little information to 
supply (within limits).  For any event (etc.) profiled by a verb, it would of 
course be possible to name reams of situational details: the journalistic 
`i.who`/, `i.what`/, `i.where`/, `i.when`/, `i.how`/, and much more.  Because, 
in English, evidentiality is not grammaticized, speakers are not forced to 
reckon wuth that branch of detailing (by contrast to tense and aspect, say) 
just to enunciate the correct verb-form; but of course ecidential phrases `i.may` be 
introduced, so a speaker can always qualify their comments with `q.it seems that`/, `q.I was told`/, 
`q.I saw that`/, etc.  Passing from the verb to its immediate neighbors, the subject and 
(sometimes) object(s) have to be accounted for, even if they aren't actually spoken 
(the subject of an imperative; the `q.here` in `q.I brought coffee`/).  Words or phrases 
have to fill in the slots of the verb's relevant conceptual matrix.  
Further outward, some added detail might actually be essnetial to the 
sentence's premise to begin with, why the speaker has reason to say it 
(as in the `q.ice-chest cooler` for the beers).  Some extra phrases may thereby 
feel ccc [mandated] by the situation at hand.  And then there's extra 
content a speaker might include for clarification, 
or parenthetically, or as a bridge to the next sentence.
`p`

`p.
Such are `q.rules`/, then, for filling in verb-related details.  Some details are 
mandated by morphosyntactic convention; others by verbs' `q.theta grid`/; others by 
discourse priorities against the relvant situational backdrop %-- if we take Grician 
conversational norms as imposing production-rules equal in force to syntax or semantics, 
then maxims such as `q.each sentence should present new information` would compel 
some detailing that would be seemingly optional, if abstracted from the current 
scenario around the dialog.  And some details `i.are` optional.  Guided by such paradigms, 
a speaker will embellish verbs with a succession of words or phrases that each contribute 
information vis-a-vis the verb in isolation from another, branching into different 
`q.zones` (in the sense I'm employing that term here), different theta-roles or 
TAME criteria, or different thematic relations.  
`p`

`p.
Figuratively, rather than visualizing beta-reduction as a state-propagation that 
collapses toward the root, condensing the a single propositional type 
(assuming the sentence is well-formed), this `q.productive` model of the sentence 
branches out tree-like in the opposite direction, starting from the verb-root 
and `q.growing` new branches (which in turn might have their own verbs %-- cf. 
`q.the dog who you saw yesterday` as a noun-phrase for, say, 
`q.our neighbors adopted`/) so that the productive process 
repeats iteratively (factorially, even).  
`p`

`p.
At one level here I'm just evoking language's compositional creativity. 
 But notice that every production outward from the verb root still has to obey 
parameters that can be modeled in terms of beta-reduction in the opposite 
direction (`i.toward` the verb).  That is, type-level beta-reduction 
captures criteria that serve as guardrails shaping the 
production of new phrasal branches supplying new details to the verb.
`p`

`p.
Meanwhile, the source material for successive verb-qualifications isn't purely linguistic; 
it is the totality of situational context, which unfolds as the sentence-production 
itself occurs.  A speaker forms an intent to create a sentence with a specific 
meaning in light of the particulars that define the scenario immediately prior 
to the enunciation (which includes what the current speaker, or others, 
have said before).  The contours of a sentence can indeed change during 
the course of its production, insofar as the speaker might observe 
addressees' reactions (or respond to unanticipated extralinguistic goings-on).  
`p`

`p.
By this account, sentence-production is a dynamic process shaped by the interplay of two 
tendencies: an outward-expand and situation-sensitive accumulation of verb details whose 
linguistic articulation begins with a verb root and branches out, from the verb's own 
inflections to surrounding words and then phrases; and, cutting in the opposite direction, 
an inward pull which constrains phrase-production accoring to rules preserving how the 
sentence as a whole `q.reduces`/, when fully understood, to a single proposition.

`subsection.Zonal Grammar and Situational Semantics`
`p.
Thus far I have proposed two genre of structural parameters which add representational 
elements to a minimal `q.term algebra` for phrase hierarchies %-- i.e., where  
phrases simply nest inside one like terms in a lambda calculus.  First there is the 
possibility of sentences having multiple reasonable parse-graphs which all contribute to 
the overall reception of that speech-act (or more precisely which all model 
cognitive processes involved).  Second, a notion of `q.zones` oriented concentrically 
around each verb embodies supplemental data for specific words and phrases, with 
inflectional marking on the verb itself constituting an innermost zone, and 
supplemental adjunct phrases an outermost zone.  In between are theta-grid slots 
(subject, direct object, indirect object), phrases that play generally requisite 
thematic roles `visavis; the verb's overall meaning, and phrases that are supplemental 
on purely lexical/semantic considerations but may be requisite pragmatically and situationally, 
such as according to maxims of conversational relevance and information-content.    
`p`


`p.
In this subsection I will explain how I see these two groups of structural parameters 
(the extra `q.topology` `visavis; `q.beta reduction modulo topology`/) as being 
sometimes interconnected.
`p`


`p.
First, consider condensed examples where multiple graphs might be in effect.  Ordinarily 
we read 

She is running.
He is sleeping.

as a simple intransitive verb (`q.to run`/) conjugated in the present-progressive.  The fact 
that is-running comprised two words is just an artifact of English not having one single inflectional 
form for progressive tenses (contrast `q.runs` and `q.ran`/).  But there's also:

The auto shop called, and your car is running again.
The trains are running on a Sunday schedule.
We were not sure she would declare herself as a candidate, but it turn out she's running after all.
He is sleeping very soundly on the sofa.

These are more metaphorical uses for `q.run`/, and in particular they involve an enduring state, not a 
physical movement, as can be seen by plausible rewrites () through ():

Your car is fixed.
The metro is open until midnight.
She is now a candidate for office.
He is passed out on the sofa.


Note that among these latter sentences, the pattern involves `q.is` as the actual 
verb (not an auxiliary) plus an adjective (fixed, open); we can read the phrase 
`q.a candidate` as `i.adjectival`/, where the `q.a` is typed as a 
function-word that converts nouns to adjectives.  If we were to notate that as 
Adj -> N, then `q.She is a candidate` would type-check as V + N + ((N -> Adj) + N) 
= V + N + Adj = Proposition, assuming that the verb `q.is` is treated as a special 
kind of verb whose second argument can be an adjective rather than a noun 
(hence V + N + Adj = P rather than V + N + N = P).`footnote.
Alternatively, we could read `q.fixed` and `q.open` as implicitly 
re-interpreted as nouns rather than adjectives, perhaps silently 
passing from the adjective to the `q.state of being` that adjective.  
The awkwardness in such an analysis is that one cannot literally 
substitute a `q.state of being` phrase: `q.* Your car is the state of 
being fixed` makes no sense.  We need an `q.in`/: `q.Your car is in the state of 
being fixed`/, which sounds correct although very non-idiomatic.  But 
that `q.in` seems to play the role of converting a noun-phrase to an 
adjective: it's hard to see `q.in the state of being (whatever)` as a 
noun-phrase, and what purpose does `q.in` serve if the argument it modifies 
and the resulting phrase are both noun-typed?  The same analysis would apply 
to locations, like `q.in England` or `q.in your purse`/.   
`footnote`  
`p`


[
`p.
As further evidence, note how gerunds can work with 
both progressive-tense and is-plus-attribute constructions; cf.: 
...
`p`
]

`p.
Moreover, it sounds normal to switch from progressive-tense 
to is-plus-attribute constructions, even in one sentence:

She is running. She must be in a hurry!
She is running and must be in a great hurry.

He is sleeping. He must be tired!
He is sleeping and must really be tired.
`p`


`p.
Since the `q.`i.is` plus adjective` pattern is ubiquitous, one is tempted to 
perceive it as affecting the reception of gerund constructions as well:

She is running for office.
She is campaigning in Michigan.
The machine is working perfectly.

Here our conceptual appraisals of the situations might be to focus on the 
adjectives as declarations of `i.state`/, and we are not attending to specific 
moments or events which brought about that state.  Elsewhere our mental 
lens instead would indeed be on a specific event that we, as observes, 
experience as ongoing and extended through time, but having some anticipated 
conclusion:

I see her, she is running home.
I see your father in the kitchen, he must be cooking dinner.

Even when a verb-instance implies physical action (not just a condition, like 
`q.working`/) our focus can apparently modulate from the specific event to the 
implicit state:

Your father is cooking Christmas dinner for everyone on Sunday.
My favorite coffee bar is opening a new location in my neighborhood. 
`p`


`p.
When our thoughts are with the state/condition described by a verb-turned-adjective 
rather than with the concrete action the verb profiles, then a parse-graph 
assigning an adjectival `q.role` seems more appropriate than one based 
on conjugations.  For those graphs, instead of `q.is` being an auxiliary 
that forms a verb-phrase like `q.is running`/, `q.is working`/, etc., 
`q.is` instead because the actual verb and `q.running` (etc.) gets reinterpreted 
as an adjective.  The two structures are obviously not isomorphic: an (intransitive) 
verb-phrase plus subject versus a (transitive) verb with subject and a direct object 
that, in effect, is an adjective.  Each structure apparently captures different 
patterns in terms of our conceptual projections within the context.  Meanwhile, 
though, the contrast between attending to a `q.state` or an `q.action` might 
be a matter of degree, not a binary opposition.  Therefore the 
patterns of cognitive focus implied by two different parse-graphs 
might both have some relevance to the concepts involved, in which 
case it is reasonable to model the graphs as somehow coexisting 
and superimposed.  Indeed, one single utterance in a given situation 
might tolerate both approaches involved in the recent examples, as in 

John is coming home.

The speaker of () could be actively watching John or could instead be reporting 
on the fact of his imminent arrival.  We would not necessarily mentally 
differentiate the two framings, and our listeners might not adopt identical 
conceptual postures to our own.  The statement of () suggests the possibility 
both of the speaker attending to John's physical motion and of the functional 
state wherein John will be at home (so they could talk to him, have dinner, go 
somewhere together, or whatever %-- the point is there's not just spatial 
location involved, but most likely some practical actions preconditioned on his 
being home rather than away); those are (I'd opine) distinct conceptualizations 
but mutually coexisting, with possibly varying degrees of foregrounding 
one and backgrounding the other. 
`p`


`p.
Similar cognitive `q.superposition`/, I believe, affects examples where 
parse-graphs differ on whether prepositions belong to verb-phrases or 
verbs' argument, which I discussed earler; cases like

We're going out to the store.
She climbed up a tree.
I looked out the window.
He fell down the ravine.


The theta-grid is `q.filled out` rather differently depending 
on whether we read `q.out` and `q.up` as attached to the verb 
or the (second) argument.  Such differences likely encode 
distinct conceptual profilings of the underlying situation.  
If `q.a tree` is the object in (), then we attend to the 
tree as a single object and `q.climb` as a completed action.  
If `q.up the tree` instead serves more as a direction for 
the climbing, then we are focusing more on finer-scaled 
spatial relations, with `q.up` being relative to the 
person during the course of her climb.  Similarly, as I've claimed 
above, () would be read as attending to the first phase of an 
itinerary if we attach `q.out` to `q.go`/, profiling the act of 
`i.leaving`/; but if we take `q.out to the store` more as a rationale 
and destination (with `i.out` removed from the verb-phrase) 
then we are anticipatorily figuring the complete trajectory. 
In (), `q.out the window` could be apprehended as a `q.path` 
for someone's gaze, with the window as a medium permitting 
sight to be unimpeded; whereas `q.to look out` with 
an object (not `q.look out` in the sense of 
`q.watch out`//`q.be careful`/) %-- such that 
the preposition merges into a verb-phrase %-- emphasizes 
instead how the subject is on one side of the window 
(inside a room, almost always) and 
whatever they're observing is `i.out`/side.  This is a more 
holistic construal than regarding the window as a 
position on a `q.path` with line-of-sight as 
metaphoric movement.  The overall pattern here 
seems to be that a preposition bound to the 
verb entails a more holistic framing, whereas 
attaching it to an object-phrase suggests a cognitive 
zoom into some more specific part of a (real or imagined) 
trajectory. 
`p`


`p.
For obvious reasons, binding a preposition with a verb, 
or not, positions it in a different `q.zone` according to 
my proposed model, since a verb-phrase would be an 
innermost zone (or almost so, apart from inflection on the 
actual verb lexeme) whereas a second-argument, direct-object-like 
position is more of an intermediary (theta-grid) zone.  
In general, passing from inner to outer zones 
involves grammatical conventions with progressively 
less concision: there is inflection on the verb itself; 
then constituents of a verb-phrase, which are in 
its immediate neighborhood; and then subject and 
object(s) sited directly adjacent to the verb (-phrase).  
Rules for these zones appear to be relatively 
formalized and strict, presumably so 
multiple semantic entities can be packed into a 
tight area without clarifying auxiliaries/prepositions 
(e.g., the dative shift being `i.only` dative).  
As our processing scans out from these `q.compressed` zones 
to more free-form, subordinate-phrase-based parts of a 
sentence, there is an overall syntactic shift toward 
isolable phrases as well as a semantic shift toward 
details which are more situation-specific and/or 
supplemental to a sentence's key meaning.`footnote.
The fact that English does not mark evidential status 
on verbs directly might apply that, in English, such 
content is less centralized than other TAME 
dimensions (tense, aspect, mood).  However, this 
status is often marked by anticipatory phrases 
such as `i.I heard that`/, `It seems`/, etc., which 
`i.precede` the root verb and, as such, perhaps a 
zonally closer than trailing information provided 
only after the verb and its intrinsic 
arguments have been accounted for. 
`footnote`  In other words, grammatical patterns 
and modulation in conceptual status work 
in synergy.  Insofar as, conceptually, a preposition 
like `q.up` in `i.climb up` has a kind of indeterminate 
status %-- not quite absolutely central to the 
verb-profiled action but not quite supplemental detailing 
either %-- it would make sense that the corresponding 
syntactic status is indeterminate or blended as 
well, as if hovering between/among two or more zones.  
This would be modeled by a superposition of parse graphs.
